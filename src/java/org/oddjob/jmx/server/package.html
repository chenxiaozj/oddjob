Classes for the JMX server side.
</p>
<p>
The server side must provide information about the remote components. The client
sees a component as something that implements a number of interfaces. 
The server side implementation behaviour of an interface is handled by a 
{@link ServerInterfaceHandler}. A {@link ServerInterfaceHandler} is provided
by a {@link ServerInterfaceHandlerFactory}. A {@link ServerInterfaceManager} 
collects together a number of {@link ServerInterfaceHandlerFactory} objects
for a given target. A {@link ServerInterfaceManagerFactory} creates a 
{@link ServerInterfaceMananger} for a given server side component.
