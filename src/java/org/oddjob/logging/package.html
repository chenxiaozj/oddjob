<p>Log Archiver functionality. These classes allow messages to be
archived on a component by component bases. Archiving is currently in
memory only.</p>
<p>Archiving is designed without dependence on a Log Implementation
so that a remote Archive can use a different underlying implementation
to a local Archiver.</p>
<p>Currently only Log4j is implemented for archiving to a
LogArchiver.</p>
